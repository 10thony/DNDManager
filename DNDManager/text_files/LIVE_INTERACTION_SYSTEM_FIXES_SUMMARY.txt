Live Interaction System Fixes Summary
====================================

1. **Import Error in CampaignDetail.tsx**
   - **Problem:** The import for `LiveInteractionCreationForm` was using a default import, but the component was exported as a named export.
   - **Fix:** Changed the import to use named import syntax: 
     `import { LiveInteractionCreationForm } from "../live-interactions/LiveInteractionCreationForm";`

2. **Incorrect Tailwind Class in CampaignDetail.css**
   - **Problem:** The class `max-width-4xl` was used, which does not exist in Tailwind CSS. The correct class is `max-w-4xl`.
   - **Fix:** Replaced `max-width-4xl` with `max-w-4xl` in `.live-interaction-modal`.

3. **@import Order in CSS**
   - **Problem:** The error log mentioned `@import` order, but all checked CSS files already had `@import` at the top, which is correct. No changes were needed for @import order.

**Summary:**
- Fixed import/export mismatch for the live interaction form.
- Corrected a Tailwind class typo.
- Verified @import order in CSS files was correct.

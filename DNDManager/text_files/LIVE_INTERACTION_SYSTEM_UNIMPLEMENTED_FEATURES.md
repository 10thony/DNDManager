- Players need a way to access the action interface when it's their turn
- Missing integration between dashboard and player action submission

#### 2.3 Template Application System
**Issue**: Templates exist but application logic is incomplete
- `onTemplateSelect` callback in `InteractionTemplates` only logs to console

**Issue**: DM status hardcoded in several places
- `isDM={true}` hardcoded in `LiveInteractionWrapper`
- No proper DM role detection for campaigns
- Missing DM assignment system

#### 4.2 Campaign ID Resolution
**Issue**: Campaign ID resolution incomplete
- `LiveInteractionDetailWrapper` uses empty string for campaign ID
- Missing logic to get campaign ID from interaction

#### 4.3 Player Character Association
**Issue**: No system to associate players with their characters
- Missing player-to-character mapping
- No way to determine which character belongs to which user

### 5. Missing Advanced Features

#### 5.1 Combat State Persistence
**Issue**: Combat state not persisted to database
- Combat state manager uses local state only
- No database storage for HP, status effects, etc.
- Missing combat state restoration

#### 5.2 Dice Roll History
**Issue**: Dice rolls not stored or shared
- Dice roller works but no history tracking
- No shared dice roll results between users
- Missing dice roll logging

#### 5.3 Reward Distribution System
**Issue**: Reward system incomplete
- XP awards implemented but item distribution missing
- No inventory management integration
- Missing reward claiming system

### 6. Missing UI/UX Features

#### 6.1 Mobile Responsiveness
**Issue**: Some components may not be fully mobile-optimized

### Medium Priority (Important for User Experience)
1. **Template Application System** - Make templates actually useful
2. **Combat State Persistence** - Save game state
3. **Dice Roll History** - Track and share rolls
4. **Reward Distribution System** - Complete reward functionality

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Advanced Real-time Features** - Enhanced synchronization
2. **Mobile Optimization** - Better mobile experience
3. **Accessibility Improvements** - Better accessibility
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - Quality assurance

## Technical Debt and Issues

### 1. Hardcoded Values
- DM status hardcoded in multiple places
- Campaign ID resolution incomplete
- Missing proper user-character associations

### 2. Missing Error Handling
- Some operations lack proper error handling
- No user feedback for failed operations
- Missing validation in some forms

### 3. Performance Considerations
- No optimization for large participant lists
- Missing pagination for action history
- No caching strategies implemented

### 4. Security Considerations
- Missing input validation in some areas
- No rate limiting on action submissions
- Missing authorization checks in some operations

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)
1. ✅ Backend functions mostly implemented (`getPlayerActionById`, `updatePlayerAction`, `getAllActiveInteractions`)
2. Create Live Interaction List page
3. Fix DM detection and campaign ID resolution
4. Integrate player action interface into dashboard

### Short-term Goals (Next 2-3 Sprints)
1. Implement template application system
2. Add combat state persistence
3. Complete reward distribution system
4. Add comprehensive error handling

### Long-term Goals (Next Quarter)
1. Implement advanced real-time features
2. Add comprehensive testing suite
3. Optimize for mobile devices
4. Improve accessibility features

## Conclusion

The Live Interaction System has a solid foundation with most core features implemented. However, several important integrations and advanced features are missing, particularly around user experience and system integration. The highest priority should be given to completing the basic user flows and fixing the hardcoded values that prevent proper functionality.

The system is functional for basic use cases but needs these missing pieces to provide a complete, production-ready live interaction experience for D&D campaigns.

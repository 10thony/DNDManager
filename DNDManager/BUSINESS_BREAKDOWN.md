  description: v.string(),
  contentType: v.union(v.literal("map"), v.literal("monster"), v.literal("quest"), v.literal("item")),
  price: v.number(),
  creatorId: v.id("users"),
  isActive: v.boolean(),
  purchaseCount: v.number(),
  createdAt: v.number(),
}),

purchases: defineTable({
  userId: v.id("users"),
  contentId: v.id("premiumContent"),
  amount: v.number(),
  paymentMethod: v.string(),
  status: v.union(v.literal("pending"), v.literal("completed"), v.literal("failed")),
  purchasedAt: v.number(),
}),

subscriptions: defineTable({
  userId: v.id("users"),
  tier: v.union(v.literal("free"), v.literal("premium"), v.literal("pro")),
  status: v.union(v.literal("active"), v.literal("cancelled"), v.literal("expired")),
  startDate: v.number(),
  endDate: v.optional(v.number()),
  autoRenew: v.boolean(),
}),
```

#### Payment Integration
1. **Stripe Integration** for subscription management
2. **PayPal Integration** for one-time purchases
